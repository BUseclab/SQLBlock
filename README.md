## Instruction

To facilitate the evaluation of SQLBlock, most of our instructions are based
around Docker containers. We create a docker container which includes a
modified MySQL server, a modified PHP dbi, and our static analysis.

### Build SQLBlock container
`runme.sh` downloads required artifacts for SQLBlock to intercept and record
issued queries to the database, and enforcing a profile.  The Downloaded
artifacts includes the modified MySQL server 5.7, SQLBlock plugin, and PHP
modified dbi. In the next step, `runme.sh` builds the docker container and create a database with the following information.
```bash
databae name: mysqldb
username: admin
password: admin
```

- Before building the docker container, you should copy the web application source-code to the directory of `/storage/webapp`.
### Run the docker container
you can use the following command to run the docker container.
```bash
docker run --name sqlblock-container -d --rm -p 9000:80 -it sqlblock
```
The web application will be accessible on `localhost:9000`.

### Generate a profile for the web application
To generate a profile for the web application use the command below to access a shell from the docker container.
```bash
docker exec -it sqlblock-container bash
```
In the next step, run the following command to load SQLBlock plugin to MySQL server and configure the plugin for recording issued query to the database.
```bash
/home/record_mysql_query
```
Now, you can visit the web application in your browser and perform various operations and SQLBlock will record any issued query to the database.
After finishing the browsing, execute the script `runme` inside the docker. The `runme` script compiles SQLBlock static analysis, analyzes the web application reside under `/var/www/html` directory, and generate a profile for the web application for the issued queries.

### Enforce a profile for the web application
Run the following command in the docker container to enforce the generated profile in the previous step.
```bash
/home/enforce_profile
```
